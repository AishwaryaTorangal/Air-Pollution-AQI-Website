# Air Pollution AQI Website

## Overview
The **Pollution AQI Website for Air Quality** is an interactive, real-time web application designed to provide comprehensive air quality information for locations around the world. The platform aggregates live environmental data from trusted public APIs, enabling users to monitor air pollution levels and make informed decisions regarding their health and outdoor activities.
The application focuses on usability, accuracy, and awareness, presenting complex environmental data in a clear and visually engaging manner accessible across devices.

## Project Description
This system utilizes reliable public APIs such as **OpenWeatherMap** and **IQAir** to deliver real-time updates on major air pollutants, including:
* **PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)**
* **PM10 (Coarse Particulate Matter)**
* **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
* **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**
* **Ozone (O₃)**
The platform features dynamic data visualizations, including interactive charts, maps, and color-coded Air Quality Index (AQI) indicators, enabling users to easily interpret pollution levels and associated health risks.
Users can search air quality data by city, analyze pollutant-specific information, and receive health advisories based on real-time AQI values. The responsive and user-friendly interface ensures seamless access across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Key Features
* Real-time air quality monitoring using public APIs
* City-based air quality search functionality
* Pollutant-specific analysis and visualization
* Color-coded AQI indicators for easy interpretation
* Interactive charts and map-based visualizations
* Health advisories based on AQI standards
* Fully responsive and accessible user interface

## Objectives
* To provide accurate and real-time air quality information
* To raise public awareness about the health impacts of air pollution
* To promote environmentally responsible behavior
* To support informed decision-making regarding outdoor activities

## Scalability and Future Enhancements
The system is designed with scalability in mind and can be extended to include:
